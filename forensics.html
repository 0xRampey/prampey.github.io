          So I employed these same methods on popular fake media throughout the internet. Here are some interesting results:

          On the far left, you can see an image of an
          <span class='bold'>
            original
          </span>
          newspaper clipping. Next to it is a
          <span class='bold'>
            manipulated image
          </span>
          which the Trump campaign had blanketed their offices with. More information on that
          <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveLemongello/status/1325534609388539909?s=09">here.</a>
          Towards the right, we have localised heatmaps of potentially tampered regions. As you can see, the article's headline and image have been replaced.

          While observant tweeters were able to identify inconsistencies in font type (Compare the
          <span class='bold'>
            'R'
          </span>
          in GORE and PRESIDENT), these visual artifacts are subtle and the tweeters had prior information that the image was photoshopped. On a larger scale and on a daily basis, it quickly becomes almost impossible to keep an eye out for subtle tamper artifacts in every image we see and humans are not very good at that either.
          <br>
          Such digital manipulation methods can be used to not only corroborate existing visual evidence of tampering but also automate the process of detecting manipulated images at scale.

            To overcome the low compute I employed special USB-type Neural Accelerators to run the machine learning and designed my Neural Network models to be smaller and run faster. I was able to achieve

            I devised a
            <i>one-shot</i>
            machine learning technique to easily onboard new user faces with just a single picture without retraining the whole model every time. Onboarding now takes about

        </ul>
        This now allows the wearable to provide real-time memory assistance

        I was also in charge of the
        <span class="bold">
          software pipelining
        </span>
        in the PAL project.
        <br>
        I built a modular wearable architecture called
        <span class="bold">PiWear</span>
        which allows for rapid-prototyping of wearable experiments involving data collection, processing, and machine learning. I designed it to be
        <span class="bold">
          highly modular
        </span>
        so that researchers after me can easily add or remove modules to suit their experiment setting. PiWear is currently being used in the PAL project for Memory augmentation, Language Learning and Activity recognition. I also led the software team with an iterative process of development, deploy, and feedback which allowed us to demo fully functional prototypes of Memory Augmentation and Language Learning to Bose and Members' week.

        I also designed
        <span class="bold">superfast and offline object recognition</span>
        for the wearable device. I was able to achieve a frame rate of 9 fps. This enables the wearable to use real-time object detection to enable contextual

        </i>
        in the real world so that the users can learn new languages in a mobile and contextual setting.

        I am also working on a novel
        <span class="bold">Activity Recognition classifier</span>
        that works in a way similar to how humans classify their own activities. Activity recognition can be used by the wearable to keep track of a person's daily activities in order to frame effective interventions or record important attributes like
        <span class="bold">sleep, productivity and exercise time
        </span>
        to gain a better insight into the user's mental and physical state and thereby, advance general well being and increase self-awareness.
