                <br>
                <!-- TODO: Make the text more spaced apart and easier to read -->
                As virtual reality becomes more ubiquitous, it is increasingly being used for <i>exposure therapy</i> sessions and <i>cognitive rehabilitation</i>
                with succesful results. 
                <br>
                <span class="bold">
                Is it possible to extend the benefit of this technology to the whole spectrum of users with physical disabilites?
                </span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Users with extreme limb motor disabilities cannot use conventional modes of user input like keyboards or joysticks.
                <br>
                <span class="bold">
                Can we devise methods to allow immobilised patients to freely interact in such virtual environments?
                </span>
                <br>
                In addition to this, can this method of interaction have other possible applications like <span class="bold">reducing social isolation </span>by immersing users in social virtual spaces populated with other virtual avatars?

                <br>
                <b>BrainShift </b> is a web-based virtual reality experiment which allows users to immerse themselves in VR using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brainwaves and eye blinking.
                It serves as a quick and robust technique that allows physically-disabled users to conveniently navigate and interact in virtual reality
                (VR) using their brain waves by combining an input modality of high data throughput and a stationary EEG activation signal.
                <br>
                Both these input modalities can be leveraged and used with even the most extreme physical disabilites like <span class="bold">Locked-in syndrome </span>. This interaction
                paradigm only requires a functioning brain and eye movement to enable immersive VR.

    <span class="header">IMPLEMENTATION</span>
    <br>
    The user is fitted with an EEG headset that monitors his concentration levels and eye blinks. A reticle in the subject’s
    field of view follows his eye gaze direction with the help of an eye-tracker. The subject is then autonomously
    navigated by a pathfinding algorithm to any visible spatial point in the environment by simply targeting his reticle
    crosshair at that particular point and executing a concentrated blink.
    <br>
    <br>
    The user can also interact with objects in his environemnt using other input modalities of the eye. Timed gaze-input can be used
    to activate levers or activate object states while left/right eye blinks also serve as distinct triggers.
