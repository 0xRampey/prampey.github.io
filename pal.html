                <br> PAL aims to enable people to design their lives (i.e. inspire behavior change) to optimize people’s cognitive, physical, and emotional well-being. People's actions deeply influence their internal and external bodily states, which
                in turn affect people's actions. PAL aims to help people to be aware of the correlations between their different activities and internal states so that better behavioral awareness can drive intrinsically motivated behavior change.
